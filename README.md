We're building Book Bot - a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within. Our learning goals are to:

1. Configure a professional Python development environment on your local computer
2. Practice building a full project from scratch
3. Deploy a Python project on your personal GitHub account
4. Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)
